	* or1k.c (or1k32bf_nop) make NOP_EXIT report exit code on
	simulator output; add NOP_EXIT_SILENT which silently exits. This
	is needed to maintain compatibility with existing testsuites, but
	we need to be able to silently exit for the gcc testsuite.
	Newlib's exit will use NOP_EXIT_SILENT.

	* or1k.c (or1k32bf_nop) handle NOP_NOP, NOP_REPORT; warn if
	unknown l.nop code is unknown
