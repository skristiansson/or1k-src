/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Tests a jump instruction using a register destination.
 * Checks whether the jump succeeds, or whether an exception is triggered (but not if the right exception was triggered yet).
 *
 * We manually construct the opcode, to allow us to force R9 into the
 * destination field, to test exception handling. Usually the assembler would
 * prevent this.
 *
 * Do not specify R31 as the register to use for the jump, as it's used internally.
